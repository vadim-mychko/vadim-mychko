AutoDiff.jl is a small Julia library for automatic differentiation, useful for basic gradient computations in machine learning and optimization.
I made it as a learning project.

Implementation of chess-like game Arimaa written in Java with a graphical user interface. The project allows loading from and saving to a predefined Portable Game Format (PGN), allows undoing steps and playing against computer or human.
